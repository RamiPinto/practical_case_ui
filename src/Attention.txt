Here we can comment everything in one place or create new txt to know when you changed sth to avoid overlapping our files.

I changed a little a structure of project. 
We talked to her last time and decided to remove favourites videos, 
because it s pretty same that playlists. So
We will have just :
-home page
-playlists
-play page
-sign in/up(I have done the functionalities, so just design here)

for now it is but if we will finish it earlier , we can add more pages if you want.

And also we need button of SIGN UP in our design and it will be on every page?

I would like to do with PHP, in that case it will be more realistic and I asked her and she said that we can use instead of .html -> .php and also instead of local Storage -> PHP code; 

.php is the same what .html, so you can write there a code html in normal, usual way, 
but additionally I will be able to add there some code from back-end and database part, so just keep coding in .php files
, please:) I hope , you  are ok with it?

And for that, to check the functionalities and to see the .php files you need to have server on your computer
So I have XAMPP, you can have sth else , doesnt matter and after you download it, just put in browser localhost/(path to file). If you need help, let me know:)

So for now we need solve which design we will have finally. So let's do just it, don't think about functionality xD

Do you want to use Bootsrap? to make it more easier , if not , we can start implement it by ourselves.
Just maybe let's devide pages between us, of course, after we finish template xD

So write here which one you want, please:)

And if you have any idea or questions, you are welcome!:)

Sorry for my English mistakes in advance!:)
