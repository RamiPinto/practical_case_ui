### 4.1.1. Main Goal
*Tubevision*, our video content platform, is a multimedia website for a diverse audience of users. Designed as an easy-to-use website, it features the ability to browse for content by category and to search for content through the use of a search box. Users to the website must subscribe in order to access the video content on the website, which spans from user-uploaded videos to TV streaming content to movies/films.  In addition, *Tubevision* is accessible via a mobile device or a traditional desktop computer.
The webpage is monetized through two forms: 1) premium subscriptions and 2) pre-content video ads. Premium subscriptions are paid versions of subscription accounts which enables special features not available to non-premium subscribers, such as unlimited offline video downloads, unlimited movies, speech interface, and video advertisement-free content. Instead of invasive display ads on the side panel, non-premium users are shown short video ads spanning several seconds before their selected video content plays.
